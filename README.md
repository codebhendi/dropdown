# Dropdown
A react component to render small to large dataset as a dropdown. It allows user to search and select multiple values.

## Steps.
1. Clone or unzip the repository.
2. Go to the directory.
3. Install all the dependencies using ```npm install```.
4. I am using react-scripts to run the development server. To do that you need to have it installed which can be done using
```npm install -g react-scripts```.
5. Now you can run the project using ```npm run start```.
6. Then on the interface you will see a dropdown. You can click on any element to select it. The current dropdown is multi select.
7. To do single select you have to remove multiselect prop from dropdown in App.jsx
